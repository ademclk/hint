# Do Aliens Use Computers?

Imagine that somewhere out there, orbiting one of the billions of stars scattered across space, there is an alien civilization. Do you think they would have invented computers? Is the computer something uniquely human, a coincidental invention belonging only to our civilization? Or is it a universal concept that would naturally emerge anywhere in the universe?

Certainly, we would be very surprised if aliens independently invented cultural products unique to humanity. Computers, however, seem fundamentally different. They feel like the inevitable solution to a universal question.

## Turing's Imaginary Machine

We often credit the invention of computers to the English mathematician Alan Turing. Although Charles Babbage had already envisioned programmable mechanical machines in a physical sense, our focus here is on Alan Turing, who first clearly defined the modern concepts of algorithms and universal computation. When Turing published his groundbreaking paper in 1936, he was not aiming to create an industry or to simplify our daily lives. Rather, he was addressing a deep question posed by the mathematician David Hilbert:

> "Is there a universal method (an algorithm) that can tell us whether any given mathematical statement is provable?"

Hilbert imagined a simple method. Just as we follow certain steps to multiply two numbers, he wondered if there could be a similar series of steps to determine whether any mathematical claim is true or provable.

To answer this question, Turing needed a clear and precise definition of what an algorithm was. Thus, he introduced the concept we now call a "Turing machine": a single universal device that, when programmed correctly, could perform any algorithm at all.

Today, this concept might seem straightforward, but in the 1930s, it was revolutionary.

## Quantum: A New Dimension in Computing

Turing's theoretical machine was based entirely on classical physics. However, in 1985 physicist David Deutsch took things one step further by asking a new question:

> "Is it possible to build a universal computer that can efficiently simulate any physical system in the universe?"

This question introduced a physical perspective to computing. Deutsch realized that classical computers were extremely inefficient at simulating quantum systems. Therefore, he proposed a completely new type of computer: the quantum computer.

Quantum computers can, in theory, do everything classical computers can, but also efficiently simulate quantum systems. As a result, quantum computers emerged as more fundamental and universal tools compared to classical computers.

## Aliens and Computers

If any advanced civilization in the universe attempts to understand the fundamental laws of reality, they would inevitably discover computers. Moreover, they probably wouldn't settle for classical computers. Instead, they would likely move forward to quantum computers, which align more naturally with the universe's underlying nature.

Perhaps someday, when we encounter extraterrestrial civilizations, we'll discover their brains themselves function based on quantum computing principles. Who knows?

## Quantum Computing

Quantum computing may seem notoriously complex and difficult to grasp. But don't worry: throughout this blog series, you will easily understand quantum computing, exploring its mathematical and physical foundations in an engaging and memorable way.
